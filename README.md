#Sample Java Script Projects [Movies Search App]
#Fully Responsive Using HTML and CSS UI Designing [Movies Search App]


##Explanation:-
This project is based on JavaScript programming, and we are calling an API provided by the TMDB website as a public API. In this project, we are designing a user-friendly UI and implementing the API to display all available movies. Users can also search/filter movies by keywords. If no results are found, a message indicating 'No results found' will be displayed.
